<p>Vuexy React and the integration with other technologies.</p>

### Backend Integrations

<p>
  We haven't tried integrating the React version with any backend framework or languages like Laravel, Express, ROR,
  Node etc..., In future we may plan to provide such integration but for now we don't have any such integrations.
</p>

### Database Integrations

<p>
  We haven't tried to integrate any Database like Firebase, Mongo etc.. with our template and don't have any guides on
  how to integrate with different databases. Users are free to choose any database and start integration.
