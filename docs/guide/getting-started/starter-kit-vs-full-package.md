# Starter-kit vs Full Package

## Starter-kit

Starter-kit is a minimal template from where you can start your project quickly instead of removing stuff that isn't needed. Below are quick notes on the starter-kit:

- No Auth
- No i18n
- Simple Navbar
- Four pages (Two sample pages + 404 + Login)
- No Customizer
- No Axios
- No Scroll to top

Use it if you don't want to clutter your project with extra libs which aren't required.

Don't worry about configuring third party libs which if you want to use them in starter-kit, our template is so flexible that all you have to do is just import lib file into your file and provide a third-party package that is ready to use üòç.

::: tip
Use starter-kit to provide reproduction steps if you raise any technical issue on [GitHub](/guide/getting-started/support.html).

## Full Package

This setup has all the things which you can see in the live demo. Except for that red Buy Now button üòÖ.

With this, you have to remove things that you don't use or replace them with your content.

### Conclusion

According to us, starter-kit is easy to get started with minimal setup and our folder and code structure will help you add libs support in starter-kit more easily than ever. Still, if your project becomes easy with the full package, go for it.

::: warning
Please make sure to copy required images from the full version if you copy content from the full version to the starter-kit.
