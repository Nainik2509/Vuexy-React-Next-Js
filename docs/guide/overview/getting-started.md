# Getting Started

We suggest you to use the starter-kit and you can copy components from the full version.

Please go through all the [dependencies](/guide/overview/dependencies.html) and remove unnecessary packages for your project.

Follow the [installation guide](/guide/overview/installation.html) once you streamline all the dependencies and make sure you meet all the requirements mentioned in the installation page to run the project and read all the notices given on the installation page.
