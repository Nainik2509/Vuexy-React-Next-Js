# Installation

react-material-admin is built using [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/). CRA is nicely documented to start off. You don't need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel. They are pre-configured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

# Guide

First of all make sure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) / [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

::: tip
Yarn package manager is recommended
:::

::: warning
Please make sure you use node's LTS version which is recommended by official node site and not one with latest feature.
:::

- After downloading zip from ThemeForest, unzip it in your desired location.
- In uncompressed folder you will find folder named `react-material-admin`. This will contain all versions of Vuexy Template. Move to `react-material-admin-template` folder and open this folder in console/terminal.
- Run below command in console:

```bash
# For Yarn (Highly Recommended)
yarn

# For npm
npm install
```

- Now you will find some output after running above command in console as below:

- Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to check frontend.

::: tip NOTE
Your network URL might not have same URL as screenshot and that is completely fine. It depends on your network.
:::

:::warning
If you have another process running at port `3000` then you might have some other URL (PORT) that screenshot.
