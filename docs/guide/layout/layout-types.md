# Layout Types

## Overview

We provide four types of layouts:

- [Vertical Layout](#vertical-layout),
- [Horizontal Layout](#horizontal-layout),
- [Blank Layout](#blank-layout) and
- [Blank Layout with AppBar](#blank-layout-with-appbar).

Each of them is explained in detail.

## Vertical Layout

This is the default layout. With this layout, you will get the following layout components:

- Navigation Menu (left sidebar)
- Navbar (at top of the page)
- Footer (at bottom of the page)

Each and every layout components are explained in [this](/guide/layout/layout-components.html#vertical-layout-components) section.

All of the above layout components are configurable. You can customize any or all layout components using [themeConfig](/guide/settings/theme-config.html) to get your desired layout.

- Navbar (at top of the page)
- Navigation Menu (on top of the page below the Navbar)
- Footer (at bottom of the page)

Each and every layout components are explained in [this](/guide/layout/layout-components.html#horizontal-layout-components) section.

## Blank Layout

This is useful if you want to create pages without any other content and where you don't need navbar, navigation menu and footer. For example, an _Authentication_ page.

Basically, this is a blank page where you can create everything from scratch.

Blank Layout in _Login_ page looks like this:

## Blank Layout with AppBar

This is useful if you want to create pages where you don't need navigation menu and footer. For example, an _Authentication_ page. With this layout, you will get navbar (or AppBar) on top of the page.

AppBar is explained in [this](/guide/layout/layout-components.html#blank-layout-with-appbar-component) section.
