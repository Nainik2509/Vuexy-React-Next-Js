# How to override menu icons and use custom icons in the template ?

If a user wants to use a custom icon library like FontAwesome or Feather, the user can install and start using that library. But the main question is how to override the icons in the menu or search?

Please refer to [this](/guide/layout/icons.html) docs in order to get your answer.

Please refer to [this](/guide/layout/icons.html#override-with-mui-material-icons) docs in order to override the icons in the menu and search with the MUI Material Icons.

Please refer to [this](/guide/layout/icons.html#third-party-icons) docs in order to override the icons in the menu and search with any third party icon library other than MUI Material Icons.

If a user wants to use a custom icon library in a **server-side menu**, then please refer to [this](/guide/layout/icons.html#server-side-navigation-menu) docs.
